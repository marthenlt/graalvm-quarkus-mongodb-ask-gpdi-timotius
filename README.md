# QnA Application for GraalVM Native Image
Original QnA application is on my other repo : https://github.com/marthenlt/ask-gpdi-tomotius-sg

Application used during QnA session of Youth Timothy's Service of GPdI Singapore which will be held on 1st Oct 2016.
The application skeleton was created in June 2016, but modified and enhanced this week 26-27 Sept 2016 during my spare times.

Framework stacks:
- UI: jQuery Mobile
- Backend: Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Web MVC and RESTful. These are part of Spring Boot Starter Libs. Refer to the pom.xml file for more info.
- DB: MongoDB

Last update - 7 Oct 2019:
- Initial code is from my original QnA application found here https://github.com/marthenlt/ask-gpdi-tomotius-sg
- Updated the Spring Boot library to 2.0.2.RC1
- Preparing for GraalVM native image

Thanks!
